/// @notice Companion to `IInterpreterV2` responsible for onchain static code
/// analysis and deploying expressions. Each `IExpressionDeployerV3` is tightly
/// coupled at the bytecode level to some interpreter that it knows how to
/// analyse and deploy expressions for. The expression deployer can perform an
/// integrity check "dry run" of candidate source code for the intepreter. The
/// critical analysis/transformation includes:
///
/// - Enforcement of no out of bounds memory reads/writes
/// - Calculation of memory required to eval the stack with a single allocation
/// - Replacing index based opcodes with absolute interpreter function pointers
/// - Enforcement that all opcodes and operands used exist and are valid
///
/// This analysis is highly sensitive to the specific implementation and position
/// of all opcodes and function pointers as compiled into the interpreter. This
/// is what makes the coupling between an interpreter and expression deployer
/// so tight. Ideally all responsibilities would be handled by a single contract
/// but this introduces code size issues quickly by roughly doubling the compiled
/// logic of each opcode (half for the integrity check and half for evaluation).
///
/// Interpreters MUST assume that expression deployers are malicious and fail
/// gracefully if the integrity check is corrupt/bypassed and/or function
/// pointers are incorrect, etc. i.e. the interpreter MUST always return a stack
/// from `eval` in a read only way or error. I.e. it is the expression deployer's
/// responsibility to do everything it can to prevent undefined behaviour in the
/// interpreter, and the interpreter's responsibility to handle the expression
/// deployer completely failing to do so.

    /// onchain as contract data and loading them from the interpreter at eval:
    ///
    /// - Loading and storing binary data is gas efficient as immutable contract
    ///   data
    /// - Expressions need to be immutable between their deploy time integrity
    ///   check and runtime evaluation
    /// - Passing the address of an expression through calldata to an interpreter
    ///   is cheaper than passing an entire expression through calldata
    /// - Conceptually a very simple approach, even if implementations like
    ///   SSTORE2 are subtle under the hood

    /// analysis) calculate the memory required to be allocated for the stack in
    /// total, and that no out of bounds memory reads/writes occur within this
    /// stack. A simple example of an invalid source would be one that pushes one
    /// value to the stack then attempts to pops two values, clearly we cannot
    /// remove more values than we added. The `IExpressionDeployerV3` MUST revert
    /// in the case of any integrity failure, all integrity checks MUST pass in
    /// order for the deployment to complete.
    ///
    /// Once the integrity check is complete the `IExpressionDeployerV3` MUST do
    /// any additional processing required by its paired interpreter.

    /// opcodes in the `ExpressionConfig` sources with real function pointers
    /// from the corresponding interpreter.

    /// if the caller has some other means to prooduce valid bytecode.
